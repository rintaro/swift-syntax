# Swift Syntax 610 Release Notes

## New APIs

## API Behavior Changes

## Deprecations

## API-Incompatible Changes

- `SyntaxChildrenIndex` is no longer `ExpressibleByNilLiteral`
  - Description: `nil` used to represent the end index. However, due to a change in the internal structure, the end index must now be retrieved from the collection.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2925
  - Migration steps: Use `SyntaxChildrenIndex.endIndex` instead.
  - Notes: `ExpressibleByNilLiteral` was a mistake. In general, `Collection.Index` should only be created and managed by the collection itself. For example, `Collection.index(after:)` exists, but `Index.advanced(by:)` does not.
